* There's a nice ZF and Doctrine 1.2.x integration available: http://github.com/beberlei/zf-doctrine/.
  Let's use it! (may require some major refactoring).
* Write unit and functional tests.
* Prepare scripts and generate project documentation from sources.
* Doctrine create-db creates database with the collation default for the MySQL server. Write some script to fix it.
* Blipoteka_Book ownership and relationship to the Blipoteka_User probably needs rethinking (especially the case
  when user decides to delete his/her account).
* Take care about situation when a user requesting a book is in the same city as holder of the book.
